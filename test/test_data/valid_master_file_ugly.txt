Complete this exam by placing an 'X' in the box beside each correct
answer, like so:

    [ ] This is not the correct answer
    [ ] This is not the correct answer either
    [ ] This is an incorrect answer
    [X] This is the correct answer
    [ ] This is an irrelevant answer

Scoring: Each question is worth 2 points.
         Final score will be: SUM / 10

Warning: Each question has only one correct answer. Answers to questions
         for which two or more boxes are marked with an 'X' will be scored as zero.

    1. The type of a Perl variable is determined by:

    [X] Nothing: Perl variables don't have a static type
    [ ] The name of the variable
    [ ] The type of the first value placed in the variable
    [ ] The compile-time type declarator of the variable
    [ ] Random chance

2. Perl's three main types of call context (or "amount context") are:

    [X] List, scalar, and void
    [ ] List, linear, and void
    [ ] List, scalar, and null
    [ ] Null, scalar, and void
    [ ] Blood, sweat, and tears

=================================================================================

    3. The "default variable" (or "topic variable") is:

    [X] $_
    [ ] @_
    [ ] $$
    [ ] $=
    [ ] The last variable that was successfully assigned to

    4. You can access the command-line arguments of a Perl program via:

    [X] @ARGV
    [ ] $ARGV
    [ ] @ARGS
    [ ] @ARG
    [ ] @_

5. The main repository for Open Source Perl modules is:

    [X] CPAN

6. The three standard sigils for variable declarations are:

    [X] '$' for scalars, '@' for arrays, '%' for hashes
    [ ] '$' for scalars, '@' for hashes, '%' for arrays
    [ ] '$' for scalars, '@' for consts, '%' for literals
    [ ] '$' for numeric, '@' for emails, '%' for percentages
    [ ] '$' for lookups, '@' for reuses, '%' for declarations

    7. The difference between a 'my' variable and an 'our' variable is:

    [X] 'my' variables are lexically scoped; 'our' variables are package scoped
    [ ] 'my' variables are subroutine scoped; 'our' variables are block scoped
    [ ] 'my' variables are compile-time; 'our' variables are run-time
    [ ] 'my' variables must be scalars; 'our' variables must be arrays or hashes
    [ ] 'my' variables are assignable; 'our' variables are constants

8. A single-quoted string (such as: 'I will achieve 100% on this exam')...

    [X] ...does not interpolate variables or backslashed escape sequences
    [ ] ...only interpolates variables, but not backslashed escape sequences
    [ ] ...only interpolates backslashed escape sequences, but not variables
    [ ] ...interpolates both variables and backslashed escape sequences
    [ ] ...converts its contents to ASCII, even if they are Unicode characters

________________________________________________________________________________


9. The term qq{XXXXX} is...

    [X] ...another way of writing the double-quoted string: "XXXXX"
    [ ] ...another way of writing the single-quoted string: 'XXXXX'
    [ ] ...another way of writing the list of strings:  ('X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X')
    [ ] ...another way of writing the array of strings: ['X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X']
    [ ] ...a call to the 'qq' function, passing it a block of code

________________________________________________________________________________


10. Which of the following is NOT a single valid Perl number?

    [X] 1'042
    [ ] 1042
    [ ] 1_042
    [ ] 1.042e3
    [ ] 0b10000010010
