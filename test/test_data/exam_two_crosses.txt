Complete this exam by placing an 'X' in the box beside each correct
answer, like so:

    [ ] This is not the correct answer
    [ ] This is not the correct answer either
    [ ] This is an incorrect answer
    [X] This is the correct answer
    [ ] This is an irrelevant answer

Scoring: Each question is worth 2 points.
         Final score will be: SUM / 10

Warning: Each question has only one correct answer. Answers to questions
         for which two or more boxes are marked with an 'X' will be scored as zero.

Total number of questions: 30

 1. The type of a Perl variable is determined by:

    [ ] The name of the variable
    [X] The compile-time type declarator of the variable
    [ ] Random chance
    [ ] The type of the first value placed in the variable
    [x] Nothing: Perl variables don't have a static type

 2. Perl's three main types of call context (or "amount context") are:

    [X] List, scalar, and null
    [ ] Null, scalar, and void
    [ ] List, linear, and void
    [ ] Blood, sweat, and tears
    [x] List, scalar, and void


________________________________________________________________________________

 3. The "default variable" (or "topic variable") is:

    [ ] $$
    [x] $_
    [X] @_
    [ ] $=
    [ ] The last variable that was successfully assigned to

 4. You can access the command-line arguments of a Perl program via:

    [ ] @ARG

 6. The three standard sigils for variable declarations are:

    [X] '$' for numeric, '@' for emails, '%' for percentages
    [ ] '$' for scalars, '@' for hashes, '%' for arrays

    [x] '$' for scalars, '@' for arrays, '%' for hashes


________________________________________________________________________________

 7. The difference between a 'my' variable and an 'our' variable is:

    [ ] 'my' variables are assignable; 'our' variables are constants
    [X] 'my' variables are compile-time; 'our' variables are run-time
    [ ] 'my' variables are subroutine scoped; 'our' variables are block scoped
    [ ] 'my' variables must be scalars; 'our' variables must be arrays or hashes
    [x] 'my' variables are lexically scoped; 'our' variables are package scoped

 8. A single-quoted string (such as: 'I will achieve 100% on this exam')...

    [x] ...only interpolates backslashed escape sequences, but not variables
    [ ] ...does not interpolate variables or backslashed escape sequences
    [ ] ...converts its contents to ASCII, even if they are Unicode characters
    [ ] ...interpolates both variables and backslashed escape sequences
    [X] ...only interpolates variables, but not backslashed escape sequences
