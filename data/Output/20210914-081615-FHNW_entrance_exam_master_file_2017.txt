1. The type of a Perl variable is determined by:

    [ ] The compile-time type declarator of the variable
    [ ] Random chance
    [ ] Nothing: Perl variables don't have a static type
    [ ] The name of the variable
    [ ] The type of the first value placed in the variable


________________________________________________________________________________

2. Perl's three main types of call context (or "amount context") are:

    [ ] List, scalar, and void
    [ ] List, linear, and void
    [ ] List, scalar, and null
    [ ] Blood, sweat, and tears
    [ ] Null, scalar, and void


________________________________________________________________________________

3. The "default variable" (or "topic variable") is:

    [ ] $_
    [ ] The last variable that was successfully assigned to
    [ ] @_
    [ ] $=
    [ ] $$


________________________________________________________________________________

4. You can access the command-line arguments of a Perl program via:

    [ ] @ARGS
    [ ] $ARGV
    [ ] @ARGV
    [ ] @_
    [ ] @ARG


________________________________________________________________________________

6. The three standard sigils for variable declarations are:

    [ ] '$' for scalars, '@' for arrays, '%' for hashes
    [ ] '$' for scalars, '@' for hashes, '%' for arrays
    [ ] '$' for numeric, '@' for emails, '%' for percentages
    [ ] '$' for scalars, '@' for consts, '%' for literals
    [ ] '$' for lookups, '@' for reuses, '%' for declarations


________________________________________________________________________________

7. The difference between a 'my' variable and an 'our' variable is:

    [ ] 'my' variables are assignable; 'our' variables are constants
    [ ] 'my' variables are subroutine scoped; 'our' variables are block scoped
    [ ] 'my' variables are compile-time; 'our' variables are run-time
    [ ] 'my' variables must be scalars; 'our' variables must be arrays or hashes
    [ ] 'my' variables are lexically scoped; 'our' variables are package scoped


________________________________________________________________________________

8. A single-quoted string (such as: 'I will achieve 100% on this exam')...

    [ ] ...does not interpolate variables or backslashed escape sequences
    [ ] ...converts its contents to ASCII, even if they are Unicode characters
    [ ] ...only interpolates variables, but not backslashed escape sequences
    [ ] ...only interpolates backslashed escape sequences, but not variables
    [ ] ...interpolates both variables and backslashed escape sequences


________________________________________________________________________________

9. The term qq{XXXXX} is...

    [ ] ...another way of writing the single-quoted string: 'XXXXX'

    [ ] Exactly the same as a list
    [ ] A container for a list
    [ ] Something that is always contained in a list
    [ ] A multidimensional list
    [ ] A list with a predeclared fixed number of elements


________________________________________________________________________________

12. An 'if' statement requires curly brackets around the statements it controls...

    [ ] ...only if the statements it controls include any variables declarations
    [ ] ...never; the curly brackets are always optional in an 'if' statement
    [ ] ...only if it controls two or more statements
    [ ] ...only if it controls exactly one statement
    [ ] ...in all circumstances


________________________________________________________________________________

13. To specify a second alternative test after an 'if', the correct keyword is:

    [ ] else if (with any amount of whitespace between the two words)
    [ ] elseif  (with no whitespace between the two words)
    [ ] ormaybe (with no whitespace between the two words)
    [ ] elif
    [ ] elsif


________________________________________________________________________________

14. "Short-circuiting" of a boolean expression means...

    [ ] ...Perl will never execute an 'else' block
    [ ] ...Perl only evaluates each boolean expression once during the program
    [ ] ...Perl programs can cause CPUs to spark if an expression is too complex
    [ ] ...Perl evaluates as little as required to get a definite answer
    [ ] ...Perl defers evaluating the expression until the result is tested


________________________________________________________________________________

15. A "foreach-style" loop (such as: for (@list) {...}) will be iterated...

    [ ] ...once per element in the list in all circumstances
    [ ] ...never, because an array is not a list and cannot be iterated
    [ ] ...once per element in the list, unless a 'last' is executed in the block
    [ ] ...endlessly, until a 'last' is executed in the loop
    [ ] ...an unknown number of times, until the list being iterated is empty


________________________________________________________________________________

16. The 'while' loop in Perl...

    [ ] ...iterates until its condition becomes false anywhere within its block
    [ ] ...iterates until its condition is true at the start of an iteration
    [ ] ...doesn't exist; Perl does not have a 'while' loop
    [ ] ...iterates until its condition becomes true anywhere within its block
    [ ] ...iterates until its condition is false


________________________________________________________________________________

17. The keywords for the Perl switch statement are:

    [ ] 'whence' and 'whither' and 'thither'
    [ ] 'given'  and 'when'    and 'default'
    [ ] 'gather' and 'take'    and 'otherwise'
    [ ] 'case'   and 'of'      and 'or'
    [ ] 'switch' and 'case'    and 'else'


________________________________________________________________________________

18. Which five Perl values are the only values that evaluate false?

    [ ] 0, '0', '', (), undef
    [ ] False, Nil, Null, None, Empty
    [ ] 0, +0, -0, 0.0, -0.0
    [ ] 0, '0', 'false', 'False', 'FALSE'
    [ ] 0, '0', '', (), []


________________________________________________________________________________

19. If the array @x contains four elements,
    how many elements will be in the list (1, @x, 2)?

    [ ] Two:   Perl ignores non-scalar variables in a list constructor
    [ ] Eight: 1 * 4 * 2 = 8
    [ ] Six:   the four array elements will be flattened into the list
    [ ] Three: the array will become a single element within the list
    [ ] None:  it won't compile; arrays can't be used in list constructors


________________________________________________________________________________

20. A hash variable stores...

    [ ] Random values, indexed by sequential keys of any type
    [ ] Values that are always strings, indexed by keys of any type
    [ ] Values of any scalar type, indexed by keys that are always strings
    [ ] Values of any scalar or list type, indexed by keys that are always strings
    [ ] Values that are unique, indexed by keys that may be repeated


________________________________________________________________________________

21. The expression 1 / 'Inf' produces the result:

    [ ] 0 (because that's the correct mathematical outcome)
    [ ] A non-fatal warning (because 'Inf' is a string, not a number)
    [ ] An infinite evaluation loop; the program will run forever
    [ ] 1 (as a convenience, to avoid subsequent division by zero)
    [ ] A fatal exception (because 'Inf' is a string, not a number)


________________________________________________________________________________

22. A "reference" in Perl is most like:

    [ ] An alias (i.e. another name) for an existing variable
    [ ] A link to the documentation for an existing value or variable
    [ ] A mutable pointer to a value or variable, without type-checking
    [ ] A deep copy of an existing variable or value
    [ ] A type-safe immutable pointer to an existing value or variable


________________________________________________________________________________

23. In Perl, you can take references to...

    [ ] ...scalars and arrays, but NOT hashes or subroutines
    [ ] ...scalars, arrays, hashes, and subroutines
    [ ] ...arrays and hashes (i.e. containers), but NOT scalars or subroutines
    [ ] ...only scalars (NOT to arrays, hashes, or subroutines)
    [ ] ...scalars, arrays, and hashes, but NOT subroutines


________________________________________________________________________________

24. User-defined subroutines are declared with the keyword:

    [ ] 'fun'
    [ ] 'do'
    [ ] Nothing: subroutines are not explicitly declared in Perl
    [ ] 'sub'
    [ ] 'sugroutine'


________________________________________________________________________________

25. By default, the arguments to a subroutine call are passed in which variable?

    [ ] @_
    [ ] $ARGV
    [ ] $_
    [ ] @ARGS
    [ ] @ARGV


________________________________________________________________________________

26. Which of the following parameter lists declares
    a subroutine that requires at least two arguments,
    but which will also accept three or more arguments?

    [ ] sub two_or_more ($data, $flag)           {...}
    [ ] sub two_or_more ($flag, ...)             {...}
    [ ] sub two_or_more ($flag, $data = @extras) {...}
    [ ] sub two_or_more ($flag, @data)           {...}
    [ ] sub two_or_more (@flags, @data_set)      {...}


________________________________________________________________________________

27. If a user-defined subroutine does not contain a 'return' statement...

    [ ] ...it will return the value the last expression it actually evaluates
    [ ] ...it will return the value the final statement in its definition
    [ ] ...it will never return and will continue to execute forever
    [ ] ...it will throw an exception after executing its final statement
    [ ] ...it will return 'undef'


________________________________________________________________________________

28. The keyword to throw an exception in Perl is:

    [ ] 'raise'
    [ ] 'exit'
    [ ] 'except'
    [ ] 'throw'
    [ ] 'die'


________________________________________________________________________________

29. How are exceptions are caught and accessed in Perl?

    [ ] Exceptions in Perl can't be caught or accessed after they're thrown
    [ ] Caught in an 'eval' block;  accessed via the special $@ variable
    [ ] Caught in a 'catch' block'; accessed via the special $! variable
    [ ] Caught in a 'try' block;    accessed via a 'catch' block
    [ ] Caught in a 'do' block;     accessed via the builtin 'eval' function


________________________________________________________________________________

30. What is the purpose of the 'use strict' pragma?

    [ ] It disallows undeclared variables, barewords, and symbolic references
    [ ] It reports all errors using verbose (and harshly worded) error messages
    [ ] It converts all warnings to fatal errors
    [ ] It prevents any construct that might also be valid C code
    [ ] It disallows package variables (all variables must be declared with 'my')
