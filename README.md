## Structure 
The Project is structured as the following:
|Folder  | Description|
|--------|------------|
|data    | Files, that are required for the program to run. Also generated files from the program can be found here|
|lib     | Modules, that are used for the main program |     
|test    | Tests| 

## Development Environment
For Developing this project, `WSL:Ubuntu-20.4` with `perlbrew` and the newest perl `v.5.34` was used.

## Idea
### File parsing
For parsing the master file, I make use of the module [Regexp::Grammers](https://metacpan.org/pod/Regexp::Grammars) on CPAN. With this Module, the parsing can be done quite easy and robust. The Grammer for the file looks as the following:
